# SKIN-LESION-DETECTION
## Project: 
Hybrid CNN and RNN model for skin lesion detection

## Goal: 
Develop an accurate and effective system for detecting skin lesions to help dermatologists identify and treat a variety of skin conditions.

## Method: 
The proposed method uses a pre-trained CNN to extract features from skin lesion photos. These features are then fed into an RNN for temporal modelling.

## Evaluation: 
The model is evaluated on the HAM 10000 dataset, a large collection of skin lesion photos divided into seven groups.

## Results:
The hybrid model achieves impressive results on the HAM 10000 dataset, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for skin lesion detection.

## Conclusion: 
The proposed hybrid CNN and RNN model is a promising approach for skin lesion detection. It has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of skin cancer diagnosis, leading to better patient outcomes.
